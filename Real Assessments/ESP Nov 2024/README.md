# Pandas and Matplotlib NOV 2024

Sample code to branch for students to test ahead of the exam

The datafile as been simulated to what you could see in the exam, the core code base is similar (as possible) to what you will have in the exam

This is a teaching tool to be able to get your head around Pandas and matplotlib

FOLDERS:
    
    MAIN: This is the starting point for you to take and then work from

    Sol1: Gives the solution to problem 1 below
    Sol2: Gives the solution to problem 1 and 2 below
    Sol3: Gives the solution to problem 1,2 and 3 below
    Sol4: Gives the solution to problem 1,2,3 and 4 below
    SolFinal: Gives the soltion to all problems and is robustness and well commented



## Task:

These are:

    Problem 1: Show the Sales over time for a specific sales peron
    Problem 1a: Show the total sales for each of the sales people

    Problem 2: Show the total sales for each of the Brands
    Problem 2a: Show the total sales for each of the Car Models

    Problem 3: Compare the total sales for more than 1 brand
    Problem 3a: Compare the total sales for more than 1 model

    Problem 4: Show the sales for a Specific Brand over a period of time
    Problem 4a: Show the sales for a Specific Model over a period of time. 


The solution must handle data in a secure way.

They have also provided user requirements for the solution. These are: 
- Program must be easy to use
- Display all information in a meaningful way
- Make use of appropriate textual, numerical and graphical output in a way that would be relevant to the end user. 

Note â€“ the data shows the number of each menu item sold for each of the given days.
