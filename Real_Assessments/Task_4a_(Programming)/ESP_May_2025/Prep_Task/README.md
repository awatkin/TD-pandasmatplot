# Pandas and Matplotlib May 2025

Sample code to branch for students to test ahead of the exam

The datafile as been simulated to what you could see in the exam, the core code base is similar (as possible) to what you will have in the exam

This is a teaching tool to be able to get your head around Pandas and matplotlib

Make sure to "Fork" the code. 

    MAIN: This is the starting point for you to take and then work from 
    
    Sol1: This the solution for task 1 below
    Sol2: Also includes the solution to task 2
    Sol3: Includes the solution to task 3
    Sol4: Has all solutions
    Solfinal: Has all solutions and robustness built in and fully commented to support learning.

## Task:

Bode Parcels has sent over their system requirements.

These are:

The existing code provided allows users to see all reports in one issue type. 

The solution must also identify trends and patterns over a period of time for:
- Task 1 - The total number of each issue type and the average rating for that problem
- Task 2 - The Number of Parcels effected for each Issue Type
- Task 3 - The Number of issues for each region
- Task 4 - A crosstab of Parcels effected vs the Rating given
- Any other information you feel will be useful to the user

The solution must handle data in a secure way.

They have also provided user requirements for the solution. These are: 
- Program must be easy to use
- Handle user error robustly 
- Display all information in a meaningful way
- Make use of appropriate textual, numerical and graphical output in a way that would be relevant to the end user. 

Note â€“ the rating shows the score given as feedback by the user on how they felt about the resolution
